This is an overview of the projects I have worked on individually and at UCD as part of my MSc in Business Analytics degree. 

# Bucket Getter - NBA Dashboard 
For Sports Analytics module, as part of the UCD MSc in Business Analytics Degree. This was built with Python, Excel, Tableau Prep and Tableau. 
The final data that the user sees through the tool is sourced from 4 different sources: Vladislav Shufinskiy’s Play-by-Play Dataset on Kaggle, Nathan Lauga’s Team Game Results & Performance on Kaggle, 
NBA’s Player Profile Repository and the NBA’s Player’s Stat Page.
- Bucket Getter is a powerful NBA dashboard tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into player performance, shot details, and team analysis.
  By leveraging shot detail data and player season data, along with advanced statistical techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation,
  Bucket Getter offers users a deeper understanding of the game and helps teams, analysts, and fans make informed decisions.
  It offers users the ability to make data-driven decisions, evaluate player contributions, and assess a team's likelihood of winning at any given moment.

- Bucket Getter offers a dedicated team-focused view for team performance and analysis. This feature utilises a Monte Carlo simulation,
  which is a statistical technique that calculates probabilities through repeated random sampling. 
  By applying 10, 5, and 3 game rolling averages, the tool estimates a team's likelihood of winning a game at any given moment.
  It provides information on what *already* happened, the result of the game, and statistical box score information including shooting percentages, assists and rebounds of the game.

- The player insights page in Bucket Getter uses real life player records, and it incorporates detailed shot data and tendency information,
  including: shot location, shot range (e.g., layup, mid-range, three-pointer), shot outcomes (made or missed), and region of the court.
  It also integrates player box statistics data, allowing users to analyse individual player performance for an entire season.
